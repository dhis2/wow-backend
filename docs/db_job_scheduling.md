## State Machine
Jobs in the scheduling process move between different states. 
The main indicator for the state a job is in is the `jobStatus` type but a few other fields also have an influence on the state.

state ONCE_ASAP {
direction UD
  [*] --> Prepared: `create` (programmatically)
  Done --> [*]: `deleteFinishedJobs` (heartbeat task)
}
direction LR
Prepared --> Ready/Scheduled: `executeNow`
Ready/Scheduled --> Ready/Scheduled: `executeNow` (run manually in app)
Ready/Scheduled --> Running: `start`
Ready/Scheduled --> [*]: delete (in app)
Running --> Done: `finish`
Running --> Running: `updateProgress`
Running --> Ready/Scheduled: `rescheduleStaleJobs`
Running --> Ready/Scheduled: `finish`
Running --> Ready/Scheduled: `skip`
Running --> Cancelled: `cancel` (user request)
Cancelled --> Done
Cancelled --> Ready/Scheduled
Disabled --> Ready/Scheduled: enable (in app)
Ready/Scheduled --> Disabled: disable (in app)
[*] --> Ready/Scheduled: create (in app)
note right of Cancelled: still running but flagged
note left of Ready/Scheduled: scheduler loop picks up here
```
OBS! 
* transition to disable and delete can apply in any state but is only shown from `Ready/Scheduled`
* `Cancelled` is identical to `Running` except it cannot transition to `Cancelled` any more (not all transtions are shown for simplicity)
* `skip` transition affects other job configurations


| State | `jobStatus` | `schedulingType` | Other conditions |
|--|--|--|--|
| `Prepared` | `NOT_STARTED` | `ONCE_ASAP` | |
| `Ready/Scheduled` | `SCHEDULED` | * | |
| `Running` | `RUNNING` | * | |
| `Cancelled` | `RUNNING` | * | `cancel = true` |
| `Done` | `DISABLED` | `ONCE_ASAP` | `lastFinished != null` |
| `Disabled` | * | * | `enabled = false` |

| Transition | From | To | Actor |
|--|--|--|--|
| `create`   | - | `Prepared` | user via other endpoints (async function) |
| `executeNow` | `Prepared` | `Ready/Scheduled` | user via other endpoints (async function) |
| `executeNow` | `Ready/Scheduled` | `Ready/Scheduled` | user via scheduler app or API |
| `start`    | `Ready/Scheduled` | `Running` | scheduler loop |
| `updateJobProgress` | `Running` | `Running` | task executor thread |
| `finish`   | `Running`/`Cancelled` | `Ready/Scheduled`/`Done` | task executor thread |
| `rescheduleStateJobs` | `Running`/`Cancelled` | `Ready/Scheduled` | heartbeat job |
| `canel` | `Running` | `Cancelled` | user request cancellation via app or API |
| `deleteFinishedJobs` | `Done` | (deleted) | heartbeat job |
| `skip` | `Ready/Scheduled` | `Ready/Scheduled` | task executor thread (of another job configuration in the same queue) |
