# DHIS2 Monitoring

## General monitoring infrastructure

The DHIS2 monitoring infrastructure is designed to expose metrics related to the application runtime and other application-related information.
Infrastucture related metrics (such as host metrics, Tomcat or Postgres) are not directly exposed by the application monitoring engine and they have to be collected separately.

The DHIS2 monitoring infrastructure is designed to work with Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/). Prometheus is, at its core, a time-series database that scrapes metrics from HTTP endpoints.
A time series is a stream of timestamped values that belong to the same metric and the same labels. The labels cause the metrics to be multi-dimensional.
Prometheus pulls data from a number of targets (as opposed to a push-based monitoring infrastructure). Prometheus is not an event-based system and this is very different from other time series databases. Prometheus is not designed to catch individual and punctual events in time (such as a service outage for example) but it is designed to **gather pre-aggregated metrics about one or more services**.

## DHIS2 application monitoring

DHIS2 exposes a series of metrics which can be scraped by Prometheus.
Currently, the metrics exposed by the application are:

- DHIS2 API (response time, number of calls, etc.)
- JVM (Heap size, Garbage collection, etc.)
- Hibernate (Queries, cache, etc)
- C3P0 Database pool
- Application uptime
- CPU

Metrics are exported by micrometer.io (http://micrometer.io/). Micrometer is a Java based framework that acts as a facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems. It supports many monitoring engines, including Prometheus.

The complete set of metrics is available from the following API endpoint:

```
/api/metrics
```

### API Monitoring

API monitoring works by intercepting incoming HTTP requests and records metrics about Spring MVC execution time and results.

The following metrics are exposed for each API endpoint exposed by DHIS2 (`/api/*`).


| name            | type    | description                                                                               |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `seconds_max`   | gauge   | a moving window of the maximum recorded value in a client-side configurable interval      |
| `seconds_count` | summary | the number of times the API has been called                                               |
| `seconds_sum`   | summary | the accumulated duration of the API call                                                  |

Each metric exposes is additionally disaggregated by the following tags:

| tag name    | description                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `method`    | the HTTP method (for example, `GET` or `PUT`)                                                                                                                             |
| `status`    | the numeric HTTP status code (for example, `200`, `201`, `500`)                                                                                                           |
| `uri`       | the URI template prior to variable substitution (for example, `/api/analytics/`)                                                                                          |
| `exception` | the simple name of the exception class thrown (only if an exception is thrown)                                                                                            |
| `outcome`   | requestâ€™s outcome based on the status code of the response. `1xx` is INFORMATIONAL, `2xx` is SUCCESS, `3xx` is REDIRECTION, `4xx` CLIENT_ERROR, and `5xx` is SERVER_ERROR |


This is an example of metrics for the `/29/analytics` endpoint:

```
dhis2_seconds_max{exception="None",method="GET",outcome="SUCCESS",status="200",uri="/29/analytics",} 2.715992829
dhis2_seconds_sum{exception="None",method="GET",outcome="SUCCESS",status="200",uri="/29/analytics",} 15.404253163

## DHIS2 Monitoring architecture

The monitoring subsytem revolves around the concept of Micrometer *registry*. A `MeterRegistry` collects metrics and exports them in the specified format defined by the chosen monitoring platform. Each supported monitoring system has an implementation of 
`MeterRegistry`. Since DHIS2 supports `Prometheus`, the configuration class `org.hisp.dhis.monitoring.prometheus.config.PrometheusMonitoringConfig` is responsible for configuring and initializing the `PrometheusMeterRegistry`.

DHIS2 exports the metrics described above through `micrometer` exporters, which are configured as Spring `@Configuration` classes.

All the exporters are located in the `dhis-support-system` module, under the `monitoring` package.

The API exporter is configured as a Servlet filter. The  `webMetricsFilter` filter is declared in the `web.xml` file of the `dhis-web-portal` module.

Finally, the `PrometheusScrapeEndpointController` is the controller responsible for exposing the `/api/metrics` endpoint. The controller simply access the `PrometheusMeterRegistry` and renders the metrics using the appropriate Prometheus-friendly format.

## DHIS2 Monitoring configuration

The monitoring subsystem is disabled by default, and can be enabled by defining a set of properties in the `dhis.conf` DHIS 2 configuration file.

Each metrics cluster has to be explicitely enabled in order for the metrics to be exported.
The metrics can be enabled by setting to `true` the following configuration keys:

| key name                       | metrics              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| `monitoring.api.enabled`       | API                  |
| `monitoring.jvm.enabled `      | JVM                  |
| `monitoring.dbpool.enabled`    | Connection Pool      |
| `monitoring.hibernate.enabled` | Hibernate            |
| `monitoring.uptime.enabled`    | Uptime               |
| `monitoring.cpu.enabled`       | CPU                  |

Please note that the Hibernate metrics activates the Hibernate property `hibernate.generate_statistics`.
Hibernate statistics are designed to help debug performance problems and are not supposed to be used on a production environment on a permanent basis.
