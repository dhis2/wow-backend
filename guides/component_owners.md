# Component Owners

## Overview

The purpose of the component owner concept is to have at least one person making sure that changes and improvements are well-aligned with the overall design and architecture of a component. This is meant to ensure that the code quality remains high and to avoid "patchwork" code fixes.

The list of components and owners can be found below:

## Responsibility

The component owner is responsible for:

* Having the complete oversight over the code base related to the component.
* Having a strong understanding of the design and architecture of the component code.
* Reviewing and testing PRs related to the component.
* Providing feedback and helping out other developers working on the component.
* Ensuring PRs align with the design of the current solution.
* Ensuring PRs maintain or improve performance, conversely avoid that PRs introduce bottlenecks.


Being a component owner does _not_ mean that you need or should to do all coding work on that component. Assignment of work is done as usual by the product manager and team lead.
   
## Workflow

When working on a PR you need to ask the component owner for review. If you _are_ the component owner, you can ask some other developer with knowledge about the code.
