# Component Owners

## Overview

The purpose of the component owner concept is to have at least one person making sure that changes and improvements are well-aligned with the overall design and architecture of a component. This is meant to ensure that the code quality remains high and to avoid "patchwork" code fixes.

The list of components and owners can be found at the following link, and in the last section of this guide:

[Components and owners](https://jira.dhis2.org/projects/DHIS2?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:components-page)

## Responsibility

The component owner is responsible for:

* Having the complete oversight over the code base related to the component.
* Having a strong understanding of the design and architecture of the component code.
* Reviewing and testing PRs related to the component.
* Providing feedback and helping out other developers working on the component.
* Ensuring PRs align with the design of the current solution.
* Ensuring PRs maintain or improve performance, conversely avoid that PRs introduce bottlenecks.


Being a component owner does _not_ mean that you need or should to do all coding work on that component. Assignment of work is done as usual by the product manager and team lead.
   
## Workflow

When working on a PR you need to ask the component owner for review. If you _are_ the component owner, you can ask some other developer with knowledge about the code.

## Component owners

The following table describes the various components and their leads.
