Anyone can contribute to the "Backend way of work" repository. This document contains guidelines about what kind of information are suited for the repository, as well as how to actually contribute.

## The scope of the repository
We want to include any information relevant to the development of DHIS2 in this repository. That includes everything from where and how to start developing and setting up and running DHIS2, to more advanced topics like working with specific parts of the code.

When determining what is suited and what is not suited in this repository, you should ask the following questions:
1. Is this information interesting to other developers?
2. Should this information be publicly available?
3. Does this information belong here (Technical) or should it be part of the DHIS2 documentation (Non-technical)?

## How to Contribute
Contributing to the repository is quite straight forward. We use markdown to write our documents which has a simple syntax you can learn more about here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

When your work is done you need to create a new pull-request for your branch in the wow-backend repository. The pull-request have to be reviewed and approved before your work will be merged.
